=================

This is the course final project for the Practical Machine Learning Course offered through Coursera.
R Markdown and the knitted HTML version of the analysis are available in the repo.

There is a gh-pages branch - the HTML should be available at http://stephanfabregas.github.io/predmachlearn-006
However, at the time of this writing, github says the page is there, but the URL gives a 404 error.
The work-around is to simply download the HTML file from the repo directly, but it is suggested that you
check the URL first as the issue may have been resolved.
